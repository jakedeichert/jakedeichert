## Hey there!

Thanks for coming to check out my work. I'm a software developer that's familiar with a wide range of technologies. I have a lot of experience with **Node**, **Docker**,  **Go**, **TypeScript** and **React**... but my go-to stack right now is **Rust** for the backend and **Svelte** on the frontend. 

🚀 I'm currently working on a fun little side project. You'll hear more about that once I ship it!

👾 I like [experimenting](https://github.com/jakedeichert/wasm-astar) with **Rust** and **WebAssembly** and can't wait to show off [more of my work](https://twitter.com/jakedeichert/status/1163153126230302721). 

🛠 I really enjoy building dev tools and automating things. [Mask](https://github.com/jakedeichert/mask) is a CLI task runner which uses a markdown file to define commands. [Svelvet](https://github.com/jakedeichert/svelvet) was an experiment in building an esm-based compiler for **Svelte**.

🧪 This year I'm hoping to get into IoT and embedded development with **Rust**. 

📘 I sometimes write about things on my [blog](https://jakedeichert.com) and you can follow my [RSS feed](https://jakedeichert.com/feed.xml) to keep up to date.
