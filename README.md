## Hey! ðŸ¥³

Thanks for coming to check out my work! I'm a software developer that uses a very broad set of technologies. I have a lot of experience with **Node**, **Docker**,  **Go**, **TypeScript** and **React**... but my go-to stack right now is **Rust** for the backend and **Svelte** on the frontend. 

ðŸš€ I'm currently working on a fun little side project. You'll hear more about that once I ship it!

ðŸ‘¾ I've done [a lot](https://github.com/jakedeichert/wasm-astar) of [experimenting](https://twitter.com/jakedeichert/status/1163153126230302721) with **Rust** and **WebAssembly**. 

ðŸ›  I really enjoy building dev tools. [Mask](https://github.com/jakedeichert/mask) is a CLI task runner defined by a simple markdown file. [Svelvet](https://github.com/jakedeichert/svelvet) is a super fast esm compiler for Svelte.

ðŸ§ª This year I'm hoping to get into IoT and embedded development with **Rust**. 

ðŸ“˜ I sometimes write about things on my [blog](https://jakedeichert.com) and you can follow my [RSS](https://jakedeichert.com/feed.xml) to keep up to date.

ðŸ‘‹ You can reach out to me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jakedeichert) or try emailing me at [jakedeichert@hey.com](mailto:jakedeichert@hey.com).
