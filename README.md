## Hey there!

I'm Jake Deichert, a lead software engineer from Toronto. Thanks for coming to check out my work!

🧰 Most of my experience is based around **Node**, **Docker**, **Go**, **TypeScript** and **React**... but my go-to stack right now is **Rust** for the backend and **Svelte** on the frontend. 

🐼 I recently launched my first side business, a jigsaw puzzle website called [Puzzle Panda][1]!

👾 I like [experimenting][2] with **Rust** and **WebAssembly** and can't wait to show off [more of my work][3] soon. 

🛠 I enjoy building dev tools and automating things. [Mask][4] is a CLI task runner which uses a markdown file to define commands. [Svelvet][5] was an experiment in building an esm-based compiler for **Svelte**.

🧪 This year I'm hoping to get into IoT and embedded development with **Rust**. 

📘 I sometimes write about things on my [blog][6] and you can follow my [RSS feed][7] to keep up to date.

👋 You can reach out to me on [Twitter][8] or try emailing me at [hey@jakedeichert.com][9].
